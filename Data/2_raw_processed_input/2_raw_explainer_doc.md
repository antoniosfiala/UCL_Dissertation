## Explain
This folder contains the live datasets used for analysis.
This means only the latest version of raw data is saved here, leaving only one copy per file.

As yet unclear if versioning will be included in the name.

The naming follows a `live_`+`file_name`+`file_type` convention.

Data is a copy of what was exported to `1_raw_processsed_backup`
No saving of new data is expected in this folder.
